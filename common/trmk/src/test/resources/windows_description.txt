This template consists of a base Windows Server 2008 R2, Enterprise Edition build. Additional features and roles can be added using the Windows Server Manager.  The hostname, Administr
ator password, and base IP will be set as part of the server creation process based on user input. Once deployment is complete, the server should be accessible via a Remote Desktop Cli
ent. This customization can take 10 minutes after the base operating system has been deployed. The operating system license is provided through the SPLA program and is done assuming th
at no application management is  being done by the managed services provider.
