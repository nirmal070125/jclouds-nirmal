VPN-Cubed IPsec to Terremark vCloud Express (Free Edition) is a free development/test-only version of the VPN-Cubed overlay network that allows you control of addressing, topology, pro
tocols, and encrypted communications for your devices deployed to Terremarkâ€™s vCloud Express. This template is packaged to work between a data center using IPsec extranet connectivity 
and Terremark. Your IPsec device connects to an IPsec gateway at Terremark running as a virtual appliance which routes to your VPN-Cubed overlay network subnet in Terremark.  An overla
y network that you completely control.  Other Terremark resident cloud machine instances "plug into" the overlay network through the use of the OpenVPN software package. 

VPN-Cubed IPsec to Terremark Free Edition creates an overlay network that uses the 172.31.1.x subnet, allows up to 5 client servers connections, and one IPsec tunnel connection.
